# Task 3: Implement User Experience (UX) Enhancements

## Objective
Improve the user experience by providing real-time feedback and progressive response rendering. This involves implementing streaming for LLM responses and a clear status update mechanism for ongoing tasks.

## Key Steps

### 1. Implement Streaming Responses

-   **Files to Modify:** `LLMService.ts`, `OrchestratorAgent.ts`, UI-side code.
-   **Task:**
    1.  **Modify `LLMService`:** Update the `requestLLMCompletion` method to handle streaming responses from the LLM provider. Instead of returning a single promise that resolves with the full response, it should accept a callback or return an async iterator to yield response chunks as they arrive.
    2.  **Adapt `OrchestratorAgent`:** Change the `processLlmResponse` (and related) methods to handle the stream of chunks. It will need to accumulate these chunks.
    3.  **Update UI Communication:** As chunks are received and processed by the `OrchestratorAgent`, it should immediately send them to the UI via the `_onDidPostMessage` event. A new message command, like `responseChunk`, should be used.
    4.  **Enhance UI:** The frontend code must be updated to handle the `responseChunk` message. It should append the incoming text to the current response area, creating a real-time typing effect, instead of waiting for the full response.

### 2. Add Task Status Feedback

-   **Files to Modify:** `OrchestratorAgent.ts`, UI-side code.
-   **Task:**
    1.  **Identify Key Operations:** In `OrchestratorAgent.ts`, identify long-running operations where the user would benefit from knowing what the system is doing (e.g., before an LLM call, when a tool is being used).
    2.  **Create Status Messages:** Before initiating these operations, create a user-friendly status message (e.g., "Analyzing your code...", "Generating documentation...", "Searching the web...").
    3.  **Dispatch Status Updates:** Send these status messages to the UI using a dedicated command like `statusUpdate` via the `_onDidPostMessage` event.
    4.  **Display Status in UI:** The frontend code must handle the `statusUpdate` message and display the information in a designated area of the UI, keeping the user informed about the agent's current activity.

## Expected Outcome
-   The user sees responses appear token-by-token, significantly improving perceived performance.
-   The UI displays clear status messages, reducing uncertainty and improving user trust while tasks are running in the background.
-   The overall user experience feels more interactive and responsive.
