# Tasks for: Integration & Testing (/testing)

## Objective
- Integrate all previously created components (Interfaces, Agents, Server, UI) and establish a comprehensive testing plan to ensure the system functions as a whole.

## Sub-Tasks
- [x] Create file `src/vs/ai-partner/extension.ts` as the main entry point for the VSCode extension, responsible for initializing and connecting all agents and UI components.
- [x] Create file `src/vs/ai-partner/testing/IntegrationTests.test.ts` to define end-to-end tests for the agent-server communication.
- [x] Create file `src/vs/ai-partner/testing/UnitTests.test.ts` to define unit tests for individual agents and tools.
- [x] Mark the final project phase as complete in `PROGRESS.md`.
