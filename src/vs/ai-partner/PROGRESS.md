# AI Partner Development Progress

## Final Objective
- To implement an AI coding partner in VSCode, following the official Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] **Phase 0-9: Initial Architecture & Prototyping**
- [x] **Phase 10: A2A Protocol Refactoring**
- [x] **Phase 11: AI-based Automated Code Fixing**
- [x] **Phase 12: State Management**
- [x] **Phase 13: Real-time Communication**
- [x] **Phase 14: Dynamic UI & Service Discovery**
- [x] **Phase 15: User Confirmation & Safety**
- [x] **Phase 16: Real-time Task UI**
- [x] **Phase 17: User Control & Interactivity**
  - [x] Added a cancel button to running tasks in the sidebar UI.
  - [x] Implemented the logic to cancel a running task's network request from the extension.
- [x] **Phase 18: UI/UX Refinement**
  - [x] **Agent skill results are now displayed directly in the sidebar.**
  - [x] Completed task items can be expanded to view details and artifacts.
  - [x] Removed the disruptive behavior of opening new documents for results.

## Project Status
- **The UI/UX for interacting with agents has been significantly improved by integrating results directly into the sidebar.**
- Users can now cancel running agent tasks directly from the sidebar UI.
- The sidebar provides real-time visibility into agent task progress.
- User safety is enhanced by requiring confirmation for AI-driven code changes via a diff view.

## Next Possible Phases
- Add configuration options for users to customize agent behavior.
- Improve error handling and reporting in the UI.
- Implement a mechanism to clear completed tasks from the sidebar.
