# Refactor Summary: Vibroborus Extension

## 1. Project Objective

The primary objective of this refactoring was to overhaul the architecture of the `vibroborus` VS Code extension. The goal was to establish a clear and robust separation between the UI (Webview) and the background agent logic, modeling the design principles of modern, scalable extensions like `geminicodeassist`.

## 2. Core Architectural Changes

The new architecture is founded on three core principles:

1.  **Separation of Concerns:** The UI is now exclusively responsible for rendering and user input, while all business logic, state management, and external service calls are handled by a system of background agents.
2.  **Message-Based Communication:** The UI and the background agents communicate asynchronously. This ensures the UI remains responsive at all times, even during long-running tasks. The `AIPartnerViewProvider` and a central "Agent Host" in `extension.ts` act as the brokers for this communication.
3.  **Centralized Orchestration:** The `OrchestratorAgent` serves as the single entry point for all user requests. It intelligently parses user intent and delegates tasks to specialized, single-purpose agents.

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### Task 1: Decouple UI and Agent Logic

-   **`AIPartnerViewProvider.ts`:** This file was stripped of all business logic. It no longer has a direct dependency on the `OrchestratorAgent`. Its sole responsibilities are now creating the webview and forwarding messages to and from the extension's "Agent Host" using `EventEmitter` and `postMessage`.
-   **`extension.ts` (Agent Host):** This file now acts as the central mediator. It instantiates both the `AIPartnerViewProvider` and the `OrchestratorAgent`, bridging communication between them. It listens for events from the UI and relays them to the agent, and vice-versa.
-   **`OrchestratorAgent.ts`:** The agent was refactored to remove any direct dependency on the `webview`. It now communicates its results and state changes back to the host via an `EventEmitter` (`onDidPostMessage`).

### Task 2: Enhance the 'Orchestrator Agent' Role

-   **Intelligent Intent Parsing:** The rigid, keyword-based `if/else if` logic for routing commands was replaced with a dynamic, LLM-based routing system. The `routeAndDelegate` method now uses an LLM call to classify the user's intent and select the most appropriate specialized agent (`DocumentationGenerationAgent`, `RefactoringSuggestionAgent`, etc.).
-   **Standardized A2A Communication:** The communication protocol for agent-to-agent (A2A) messages was simplified. Specialist agents now return a standardized payload (`{ rawContent: '...' }`), which decouples the `OrchestratorAgent` from the internal implementation details of the specialists.

### Task 3: Implement User Experience (UX) Enhancements

-   **Streaming Responses:** The `LLMService` was updated to handle streamed responses from the API. The `OrchestratorAgent` now processes these streams, and the `MainView.tsx` UI component was refactored to handle `responseStart`, `responseChunk`, and `responseEnd` messages, rendering text as it arrives for a real-time typing effect.
-   **Task Status Feedback:** A `statusUpdate` message channel was created. The `OrchestratorAgent` now sends messages to the UI before initiating long-running tasks (e.g., "Finding the right tool...", "Thinking..."), keeping the user informed of the system's current state. The `MainView.tsx` was updated to display these status messages clearly.

## 4. Final Outcome

The refactored `vibroborus` extension now possesses a more robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture. The clear separation of concerns makes future development easier, and the UX enhancements provide a significantly more responsive and transparent experience for the user.
