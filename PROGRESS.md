# Progress Report

**Status: Implementation Complete**

The development of the Vibroboros AI Partner, as detailed in `PLAN.md`, is now complete. All core architectural components, agent functionalities, and UI features have been implemented in the current codebase.

## Key Completed Features:

- **[Done]** **Core Architecture**:
    - Implemented the central `OrchestratorAgent`.
    - Established the internal A2A dispatch system and the MCP tool server.
    - Integrated core services for configuration, authentication, logging, and LLM communication.

- **[Done]** **Specialist Agents**:
    - All specialist agents (`CodeAnalysis`, `ContextManagement`, `RefactoringSuggestion`, `DocumentationGeneration`, `SecurityAnalysis`, `CodeWatcher`, `AILedLearning`, `ContextArchive`) are implemented and integrated.

- **[Done]** **Intelligent Context Management**:
    - **Conditional Pruning**: The system can now mark disposable content with `<prunable>` tags and replace it with a placeholder to save tokens.
    - **Conversation Summarization**: The system automatically summarizes long conversations to stay within token limits.
    - **Long-Term Memory**: The `ContextArchiveAgent` successfully archives and retrieves pruned context, providing the AI with a long-term memory.

- **[Done]** **Interactive UI Features**:
    - Implemented UI actions for one-click refactoring and documentation creation.
    - The UI now supports full chat session management (create, select, delete).

- **[Done]** **Proactive & Background Tasks**:
    - The `CodeWatcherAgent` successfully triggers security scans and re-indexing on file saves.
    - The `SecurityAnalysisAgent` reports findings to the VS Code "Problems" panel.

The project is now in a state that matches the blueprint laid out in `PLAN.md`.
