# Contributing to Vibroboros

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Vibroboros! It's people like you that make open source such a great community. We welcome any form of contribution, from reporting bugs and suggesting features to writing code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/vibroboros/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-repo/vibroboros/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **Check if the enhancement has already been suggested** in the [Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/vibroboros/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/your-repo/vibroboros/discussions).
- Open a new issue or start a discussion to explain your idea. Please provide as much context and detail as possible.

### Pull Request Process

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).
4.  Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`).
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

- We use Prettier to format our code. Please run `npm run format` before committing your changes.

We look forward to your contributions!
